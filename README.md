# .NetArcCourse

A comprehensive collection of C# tutorials, exercises, and sample projects demonstrating core programming concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and application development using the .NET 9.0 framework.

This repository serves as an educational resource for learning C# and .NET, showcasing various programming paradigms such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, exception handling, multithreading, and more through practical examples.

---

## Key Features

- **Educational exercises** covering fundamental programming concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, constructors, and abstract classes
- **Data Structures**: arrays, lists, multidimensional arrays
- **Control Structures**: loops (`for`, `while`, `foreach`), conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`)
- **Advanced Concepts**: generics, method overloading/overriding, type casting, exception handling
- **Application Samples**: simple calculators, file I/O, logging, game logic, and more
- **Modular structure**: organized into directories per topic with dedicated sample files

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) installed on your machine
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Visual Studio

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/69killian/.NetArcCourse.git
cd .NetArcCourse
```

2. **Navigate to a specific project folder**

Each folder contains a C# console application. For example:

```bash
cd array-of-objects
```

3. **Restore dependencies**

Most projects are simple console apps that rely on the .NET SDK. Run:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. **Build the project**

```bash
dotnet build
```

---

## Usage

### Running individual projects

Navigate to the desired project directory and execute:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Examples

- To run the **Facture** example:

```bash
cd Facture
dotnet run
```

- To run the **Calculator**:

```bash
cd calculator
dotnet run
```

### Environment setup

No special environment variables are required. Some projects involve file I/O or logging, so ensure the directories (like `logs/`) exist or are created by the code.
